# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added
- Interactive project HTML and local development server embeds in the canvas, rendered in
  script-enabled sandboxed iframes without access to the parent DOM.
- `excalibridge embed <canvas> <html>` appends a project HTML page without replacing existing
  canvas content. Embed links are preserved on save and included in agent change detection.
- A runnable HTML/canvas example and tests for embed paths, URL policy, and server delivery.

### Fixed
- Static project serving now rejects symlinks that escape the project root.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- A question card or reply that made its section grow had its own lower parts pushed away from
  it. The block that causes the growth is now excluded from the push.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- Section look: accent-coloured dashed outline with no fill (was a pastel fill). `tidy` restyles
  existing sections to the current look.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- The viewer hides Excalidraw's frame outline and name; sections are shown by their backdrop and
  coloured title only.

### Fixed
- The viewer no longer overwrites changes made on disk by the agent while it holds unsaved edits.
  It merges: disk is the base, this tab's added/modified/removed elements are applied on top, and
  a save first merges whatever is newer on disk.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- `tidy` now extends a section upward when its content would sit under the coloured title.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added
- Sections get a pastel backdrop and a coloured title from a cycling palette, so topics read at a glance.
- `excalibridge tidy <file>`: enforce a minimum gap between stacked sections, (re)apply section
  styling, and keep backdrops in sync. Members move with their section.

### Changed
- Wrapped sections reserve room for the title above the wrapped content.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added
- Sections: `excalibridge section <file> "title"` adds a titled Excalidraw frame. New question
  cards land in the latest section, which grows to fit; sections flow to the right and wrap to a
  new row past the canvas width. `--wrap-y` wraps existing content.
- Replies are laid out instead of dropped as a single line: inside a question card they become a
  blue block that extends the card; elsewhere a blue callout box directly under the element.
  Text is wrapped to the available width and anything below is pushed down.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- `ask` numbering now continues after hand-written `Q<n>` headings already on the canvas, and
  `--number` forces a specific number.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added
- `excalibridge ask`: numbered question cards with an answer line the user completes in place.
  Completed answers appear in `changes` with `role: "answer"`, the answer text, and the owning card.
- Per-project labels (`excalibridge config --label answer '답변: '`) so cards and replies can use
  the user's language; `reply` defaults to the project's reply label.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- When there is nothing to send, the button stays hoverable and clickable: the tooltip and a click
  explain why (the agent has seen everything), and Shift+click still forces a send. The status line
  now reads "Agent is caught up" or "N change(s) to send" instead of the file path.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- Change detection compared Excalidraw's `version` counter, so text the viewer re-measured after a
  CLI reply showed up as a user edit. It now compares content and placement (text, position,
  colours, points, and size for non-text shapes).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added
- The send button is disabled while there is nothing new for the agent (no unsaved edits and no
  changes since the agent last marked the file seen). It re-enables as you draw and turns off again
  once the agent has caught up. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter still forces a send.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- Viewer fetched the canvas relative to the viewer URL and showed an empty scene; it now fetches
  from the project root and reports load failures instead of staying silent.
- `excalibridge serve` passed `--root` after the subcommand when spawning the daemon.
- Request body parsing in the server (syntax error).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added
- Local server that serves a project root, saves `.excalidraw` files, and exposes
  `changes`, `seen`, `mtime`, and `send` endpoints.
- Excalidraw viewer with a send button in the top-right toolbar, autosave, reload on
  external change, send cooldown, and skip-when-nothing-changed.
- CLI: `open`, `new`, `changes`, `seen`, `reply`, `send`, `serve`, `stop`, `status`, `config`, `notify`.
- Wake-up adapters: inbox (always on), T3 Code webhook, herdr agent prompt, custom command.
- Agent skill (`SKILL.md`) and canvas notation (`references/protocol.md`).
- herdr plugin manifest with an "open canvas here" action.
